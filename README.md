# Project 2

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This project is a chat web application using Python in server-side and JavaScript in client-side.  A user needs to input a name. The user can then create a channel or join an existing channel. In that channel, user may send message. Lastly, the user may delete any message from any channel as long as he/she is its author.  

I had a hard time understanding some of the concepts behind building this application. In this regard, I would like to give credit to Lukasz Jaworski for posting his sources publicly. I have learned a lot from his work. You may check his project 2 at https://github.com/nobaa36/CS50-s-Web---project-2-Flack.git
